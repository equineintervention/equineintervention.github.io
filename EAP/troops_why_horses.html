                <p><strong>Date: July 4, 2001</strong>...<em>They are all depending on me to make the decision&hellip;Do we run and hide from this predator we cannot see? Or do we stay and fight for our territory possibly losing the lives of one our group? The booming sound and smell of fire is coming from so many directions, my breathing is labored and nostrils flare as I strain to determine where the enemy lies? Flashes of light storm above our heads and rain down onto the spot where we bed down every night. Every muscle is tense and quivering with my own fear- do the others sense it? <strong>- Sugar (Alpha Mare)</strong></em><br />
                    <br />
<strong>Why Horses?</strong>  Horses are a prey species whose survival throughout their evolutionary history has centered on a fight or flight instinct. The survival of the herd is dependent upon adherence to a strict hierarchy based on trust, loyalty, and a common goal-survival. Each herd consists of an Alpha horse that is “in charge” of the rest of the herd, a Beta horse that works as second in command and is constantly vigilant, monitoring the surrounding environment for potential threats to the herd. The remaining horses all work for the benefit of the herd, rely on the decisions of the Alpha and Beta horse and comply without question. Rebellion within the herd is met with isolation and often physical aggression in order to maintain balance and protect the herd. Horses may have been domesticated, but thousands of years of instincts have remained giving these animals heightened awareness of their environment, incredible perception and the ability to reach into the human soul where the deepest parts of our being lie. </p>
