<h3>What is EAL?</h3>
<p>Equine Assisted Learning is an experiential method to help participants improve their relationship skills both personally and professionally.

Like EAP, equine assisted learning sessions are facilitated by a certified equine specialist and a licensed therapist.  EAL is an extremely beneficial and innovative alternative for businesses, youth groups, civic groups, and any other organization that is looking to improve the overall morale and enthusiasm of its members. </p>
