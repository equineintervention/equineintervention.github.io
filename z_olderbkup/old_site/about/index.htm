<h3>How Does Equine Assisted Therapy Work?</h3>
<p>EAP and EAL both center on ground activities that require clients to build or improve their skills in areas such as problem-solving, relationships, verbal and nonverbal communication, confidence, teamwork, and many more essential life skills. The goal of equine assisted therapy is not to teach riding or horsemanship, but to allow clients to be creative and work on their own solutions versus being directed by an instructor.</p>
<h3>Why Horses?</h3>
<p>Horses are powerful animals that have incredible perception and instincts. Horses have the ability to mirror strengths, weaknesses, and emotional well-being based strictly on non-verbal communication. Horses are social animals that have family/herd dynamics much like our own, which allows for an emotionally safe environment to examine our own lives. The horses create metaphors that parallel every day life in a way that no other therapy can possibly achieve.  Horses provide a positive experience that clients will carry with them indefinitely.</p>
<h3>How Can You Benefit From Equine Intervention?</h3>
<p>EAP services offered by Equine Intervention, LLC will allow you to efficiently and effectively assess your clients and help them find their own solutions through various activities with horses. We have four service options at Equine Intervention:</p>
<p><strong>Option 1:</strong> Bringing Your Clients to an EAP Session: Equine Intervention, LLC is owned by Debby Alexander , an EAGALA certified  equine specialist.  The Equine Assisted Growth and Learning Association is an international organization dedicated to improving the mental health of individuals, families, and groups around the world by setting the standard of excellence in Equine Assisted Psychotherapy. Alexander brings over 20 years of experience in equine services including riding lessons, training, and equine behavior.  In addition to EAGALA certification, Alexander currently holds a Bachelor of Science in Biology from Francis Marion University, has five years of teaching experience in area high schools, and is pursing a Masters degree in Mental Health Counseling. Alexander's certification allows her to work in conjunction with any licensed therapist or counselor to facilitate EAP or EAL sessions. The EAGALA model requires the equine specialist and the therapist to work together to insure that the client receives the absolute maximum benefits of equine assisted therapy. Sessions last on average one hour for individual or marriage therapy and an additional thirty minutes for family therapy. EAP is as effective with clients you are treating for the first time as it is for clients you have treated for extended periods of time. </p>
<p><strong>Option 2:</strong> Referring Clients to the Equine Intervention Team: If you would like to refer clients to Equine Intervention, LLC we have a facilitating team for that purpose composed of the Certified Equine Specialist and a Licensed Professional Counselor.  Madge W. Zemp is the LPC who handles referrals for Equine Intervention, LLC. Mrs. Zemp holds a B.A. in Education as well as a M.Ed. from Clemson University in Guidance and Counseling Services. Zemp has over 20 years of experience in education and 10 years in therapeutic services. She currently teaches both history and psychology and provides private counseling services. Treatment varies widely from client to client, but on average clients attend 12-15 EAP sessions. Referring clients to our treatment team will allow your clients to benefit from EAP even if you do not have time to participate as part of the treatment team. Observations and assessment can be provided with client consent to the referring therapist if you are or will continue to treat outside of EAP. </p>
<p><strong>Option 3:</strong> Coming to EAP On Your Own: If you are interested in experiencing the benefits of therapeutic services through EAP and are not already under the care of a licensed therapist you may contact Equine Intervention, LLC and our team will be happy to assist you. </p>
<p><strong>Option 4:</strong> Corporate Team Building and EAL:  Team building sessions are a great tool for ironing out the dynamics of your management or employee teams. Sessions focus on leadership, communication, and problem-solving skills that will benefit your employees personally as well as professionally. Team building sessions are conducted as half or whole day sessions and are facilitated by an Equine Services, LLC treatment team. If you have someone on staff that provides therapeutic services we would love to have them join us as part of the team for your sessions. </p>
