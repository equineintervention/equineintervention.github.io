             <h3>EAP Program for Troops &amp; their Families</h3>
                
              	<ul>
                <li><strong>Series 1: Pre-deployment - Family Sessions</strong> can help soldiers, spouses, and children work through issues that may come up before deployment such as anxiety, feelings of isolation &amp; being overwhelmed, grief, inadequacy &amp; detachment.</li>
                <li><strong>Series 2: Deployment - During Deployment Families</strong> may continue to participate in sessions help to develop positive coping strategies for managing the transitions that take place in family dynamics after their spouse has been deployed. EAP will also help improve communication skills, decision-making skills, confidence, and teamwork.</li>
                <li><strong>Series 3: Reintegration to Civilian Life - Post-Deployment</strong> offers new challenges for soldiers and their families as they reintegrate into civilian life. Soldiers in combat are in a constant state of fight or flight. Horses have been existing in this state since they first appeared on earth. Horses are a prey species and are observing and adapting to their environment every second of the day. The herd works together to increase their chances at survival. This is a concept soldiers can immediately relate to. Soldiers in combat develop coping strategies such as detachment, numbing, denial, tunnel vision in order to emotionally protect themselves during deployment. &nbsp;As a result of the coping strategies soldiers must employ they may experience some or all of the following issues during reintegration: Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), depression, addictions, identity problems, anxiety/panic attacks, sleep disorders, grief, and anger management. EAP can help soldiers individually, in groups, or in family settings to overcome the challenges they face during reintegration. </li>
