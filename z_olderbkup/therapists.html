		<h3>Bringing Your Clients to an EAP/EAL Session</h3>

<p>Equine Intervention, LLC is owned by Debby Alexander, an EAGALA certified  equine specialist.  The Equine Assisted Growth and Learning Association (EAGALA) is an international organization dedicated to improving the mental health of individuals, families, and groups around the world by setting the standard of excellence in Equine Assisted Psychotherapy. Alexander brings over 25 years of experience in equine services including riding lessons, training, and equine behavior.  In addition to EAGALA certification, Alexander currently holds a Bachelor of Science in Biology from Francis Marion University, has six years of teaching experience in area high schools, and is pursing a Masters degree in Mental Health Counseling. Alexander's certification allows her to work in conjunction with any licensed therapist or counselor to facilitate EAP or EAL sessions. The EAGALA model requires the equine specialist and the therapist to work together to insure that the client receives the absolute maximum benefits of equine assisted therapy. Sessions last on average one hour for individual or marriage therapy and an additional thirty minutes for family therapy. EAP is as effective with clients you are treating for the first time as it is for clients you have treated for extended periods of time. </p>
